## Installing Python 3.10 on an Ubuntu 20.04 system

Here are the steps to install Python 3.10 on Ubuntu 20.04 using the <code>deadsnakes</code> PPA, which is a third-party repository providing newer versions of Python:

### Step 1: Update Package List

First, open a terminal and update your package list to ensure you have the latest updates for all your installed packages. This is good practice before you install any new software.

```
sudo apt update
```

### Step 2: Install Software Properties Common

You’ll need `software-properties-common` if it's not already installed to manage the repositories more easily:

```
bashCopy code
sudo apt install software-properties-common
```

### Step 3: Add the Deadsnakes PPA

The `deadsnakes` PPA is a well-regarded source for newer Python versions. Add this PPA to your system:

```
bashCopy code
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

### Step 4: Install Python 3.10

Now you can install Python 3.10 from the newly added repository:

```
bashCopy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.10
```

### Step 5: Verify Python 3.10 Installation

After the installation is complete, you can verify it by checking the Python version:

```
bashCopy code
python3.10 --version
```

### Step 6: Install Pip for Python 3.10

To manage packages in Python 3.10, you’ll likely want to install `pip` specifically for Python 3.10:

```
bashCopy code
sudo apt install python3.10-distutils
curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3.10
```
